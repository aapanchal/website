                (“OficeInspector,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” if not explicitly referring to one company) follow when handling
                Personal Information (defined below) that we collect or receive in conducting our business, including
                through our products, services, content, websites, and user applications (the “Sites”), as further
                explained below. Employment data is not subject to this Privacy Policy, but will be covered under
                separate policies and procedures of, and agreements among, the various OficeInspector companies. If you are a
                resident of the European Union (“EU”), you may have additional rights under the EU General Data
                Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Information, as outlined below. For the
                purposes of this Privacy Policy, references to the EU also include the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and
                the European Economic Area countries Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, WE DO
                NOT SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>

            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “Personal Information” to mean

                information about you, such as your name, company name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and
                email address. It may also include information on the content, products, or services you have shown

            <p class="text-muted mb-0">ANALYTIC TECHNOLOGIES</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">We use certain common methods and technologies to collect and store Usage
                Information about your interaction with our Sites (“Analytic Technologies”). These Analytic Technologies
                may be downloaded to the personal computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone that you use to access the
                Sites (“Your Device”). The specific Analytic Technologies that we use are as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on Your Device when you visit our Sites.
                We use cookies only to facilitate the use and navigation of our Sites and to remember you and your
                preferences in case you revisit our Sites in the future and to conduct range measurement. Many browsers
                allow blocking of cookies in their entirety, removal of existing cookies, or warning to prevent the
                placing of a cookie. Please note that blocking of cookies might impede your use of our Sites. For more
                information, please see our Cookie Policy www.OficeInspector.com/cookie-policy. If you are a resident of the
                EU or other jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our Sites, then you
                will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on such Sites; except that certain cookies
                are essential to enable core site functionality, and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Web Beacons. A web beacon, including tracking pixels, is a small graphic image or
                other web programming code, also known as “1×1 GIF” or “clear GIF.” We may download web beacons to Your
                Device when you access our Sites or through email messages that we send to you. Web beacons are used to
                improve your experience on our Sites. Web beacons also help us to understand whether users read email
                messages and click on the links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content
                and messages. Our web beacons may collect certain of your contact information (e.g., the email address
                associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to
                collect information about your interactions with our Sites, such as which links within our Sites you
                click on, which type of browser or device you use (e.g. mobile or desktop version). We use such
                information to enhance the user experience. This code is downloaded onto Your Device when you access our
                Sites and is deactivated or deleted when you leave our Sites. Identification of the user does not take
                place.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Analytics. We use analytics applications, including “Google Analytics” and “Heap
                Analytics”, to collect information about use of our Sites. These applications collect information such
                as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they
                visited prior to coming to a website. We use the information obtained from these applications only to
                improve our Sites and our product and service offerings. The information generated about your use of our
                Sites will be transferred and saved to the vendor’s server in the United States. For Google Analytics,
                within Member States of the European Union or other signatories of the Agreement on the European
                Economic Area, Google will first shorten your IP address. In exceptional cases, the full IP address will
                be transferred to a Google server in the United States to be shortened there. Google’s ability to use
                and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the
                Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can opt-out of Google Analytics
                tracking by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. Likewise, Heap Analytics’ ability to use
                and share information collected by their application about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the
                Heap Analytics Terms of Use and the Heap Analytics Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Do Not Track Policy. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may
                collect information about your online activity after you leave our Sites. Just like any other Usage
                Information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Sites and customize your online
                experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not
                Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services
                (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your
                online activities over time and across different websites. Our Sites do not support Do Not Track
                requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you
                are using the Sites and after you leave our Sites.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">CUSTOMER END USER DATA</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">This privacy policy does not apply to customer end user data. With respect to our
                customers, we are a data processor, and we process the personal data collected by our customers only in
                accordance with the instructions of our customers. Our customers may use the Sites and Services to
                better understand how their own users (“Customer End Users”) engage with their products and services.
                The Personal Information that we may process regarding Customer End Users is referred to as “Customer
                End User Data.”</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Our customers, not us, choose the type of Customer End User Data processed
                through their use of our Sites. We process the Customer End User Data only according to the instructions
                of customers. The collection of Customer End User Data is governed by our customers’ privacy policies
                and notices, and if you are a Customer End User then you should review the customer’s privacy policy to
                learn more about the customer’s data handling practices</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">While we recognize that an individual may have the right to access, delete and
                amend the data collected about that individual, we do not have a relationship with Customer End Users
                but rather only with our customers. If you are a Customer End User and you would like to access, amend
                or delete your data, then you need to contact the customer directly, and we will respond within a
                reasonable period of time to any such request by our customer.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Business Use. We use your Personal Information primarily to facilitate our
                ongoing and proposed business dealings with you (“Business Use”). This includes to: (1) process business
                transactions with us that you initiate, including without limitation orders of products and services and
                the creation of user profiles; (2) establish and maintain customer accounts so that we may provide
                products or services of ours requested by you or your company; (3) register you as a user of these
                products or services so that you may access them through our Sites or otherwise; (4) communicate with

                notify you about changes to any of the policies and procedures for use of these products or services;

                company in relation to these products or services; (8) respond to questions or inquiries that you or
                your company may have about our products or services. We also may use your Personal Information as
                required for us to comply with laws and regulations relating to the products or services that we provide
                in any of the jurisdictions in which we or our affiliated companies operate, including the United
                States; and (9) we may use Usage Information internally within OficeInspector to help us improve our products
                or services, or to develop new products or services.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">We may also use your Personal Information to personalize the content of the Sites
                and communications based on your preferences, and to comply with our legal or contractual obligations
                and to resolve disputes. Additionally, we may use your Personal Information to protect against or deter
                fraudulent, illegal, or harmful actions and to enforce our terms and conditions of use (depending on
                which product or service you are using).</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Marketing Purposes. With your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable
                law, we may use your Personal Information for purposes relating to the marketing of our content,
                products,
                and services, or those of our business partners (“Marketing Purposes”). This includes to: (1)
                send you newsletters, press releases, event announcements, and other similar communications

                services to you, including by offering you trial or limited access to certain of our products or
                services; (3) either directly or through third-party services, solicit input from you regarding
                improvement of our products or services, including but not limited to, Beta programs, product
                ratings and reviews, and interviews; (4) inform you of third-party offerings that we think you or

                the time we obtain your consent.</p>


            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Referrals. From time to time, we may receive Personal Information about you from
                third parties who recommend or suggest that we contact you for business purposes. We receive such
                Personal Information because you have consented towards the third party that they might share your
                Personal Information. If we use that information to contact you, it will only be to see if you are
                interested in our products or services, or those of our business partners. We will not use this
                information for other purposes without your consent. In addition, if you inform us that you are not
                interested in these products or services, we will stop using the information to contact you.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Data Integrity. You are responsible for the accuracy of all Personal Information
                that you provide to us. We will use reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and integrity of your
                Personal Information, and to update that information as appropriate. We will take reasonable steps to
                ensure that the Personal Information we collect from you is relevant to its intended use, and that it is
                used only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise
                authorized by you.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Automated Decision Making. We do not use any personal data provided by you for
                the purpose of automated decision-making.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing
                legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to
                comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to retain your Personal
                Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because
                your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal
                Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">WITH WHOM WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Within OficeInspector. OficeInspector is a company that transacts business across national
                borders. Accordingly, from time-to-time and subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy governing
                “CHOICE AND UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES” (see below), we may share your Personal
                Information within OficeInspector (i.e., between and among OficeInspector and its subsidiaries). Such information
                may be used by each OficeInspector entity for internal business and operational purposes, as well as for
                purposes consistent with the purpose for which the information was originally collected or subsequently
                authorized by you.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Outside of OficeInspector. We may share your Personal Information with “Data
                Processors” as described below, and with other third parties for purposes disclosed to you at the time
                you provided the information, or as subsequently authorized by you. From time to time, we also may offer
                you the option of sharing your Personal Information with third parties in order to receive information
                and/or marketing offers from them or other persons. If you consent to the sharing of your Personal
                Information for these purposes, it will be subject to the privacy policies and business practices of
                those third parties. If you later decide that you no longer want us to share Personal Information with
                such third parties, please contact us as indicated below under the section “CHOICE AND UPDATING YOUR
                INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES.” We will process your request in a reasonable period of time. Note,
                however, that if you no longer wish to receive communications from a third party which has already
                received your Personal Information from us, you will need to contact that third party directly to inform
                them of this.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Data Processors. We may, from time to time, employ Data Processors to perform
                services on our behalf, such as: (1) hosting our Sites, products, and other applications; (2) designing
                and/or operating certain features available through our Sites; (3) sending emails and other
                communications relating to our products or services; (4) fulfilling and processing orders for our
                products or services; (5) assisting with promotions and conferences relating to our products or
                services, or those of our business partners; (6) providing analytic services, such as in relation to the
                tracking of usage of our Sites; or (7) performing other administrative services for us. We may provide
                these Data Processors with access to your Personal Information in order for them to complete a requested
                transaction or otherwise perform services for us or for you on our behalf. To the extent permitted under
                applicable law, prior to allowing our Data Processors to access your Personal Information, we will enter
                into a data protection agreement or addendum (“DPA”) with them to ensure that they handle and process
                the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law as instructed by us.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Partners. We may also share your contact information with the following partners
                so that we can better serve you:</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Distributors and resellers: if you are in a location where we primarily sell our
                products and services through a distributor or reseller, we may pass your contact information on to such
                distributor or reseller so that they can contact you directly about your interest in OficeInspector’s
                products and services.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Managed Service Providers: we may share your contact information with third
                parties that provide an offering or service that runs the OficeInspector product for you. If that managed
                service provider is also an OficeInspector reseller or distributor, you may purchase the OficeInspector product
                directly through them.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Implementation Partners: we may share your contact information with partners who
                can help you with implementation and integration of OficeInspector into your environment.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Training Delivery Partners: we may share your contact information with partners
                that we work with to deliver training for OficeInspector products in certain locations, so that such partner
                can facilitate the delivery of the training directly to you.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Site Hosting. Our Sites and the servers on which they are hosted are operated in
                various countries around the world in which we conduct our business. Thus, your Personal Information
                associated with our Sites may be transferred to and/or processed in a country other than that from which
                it was collected. The data protection laws in those countries may differ from those of the country in
                which you are located. The servers may be operated by third party hosted service providers. If you are a
                resident of the EU, any such transfers will be made in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Links to Other Websites and Applications. The Sites may contain various links to,
                as well as plug-ins or widgets from, social media and other third-party websites or applications, which
                may provide additional information, goods, services, and/or promotions. These third-party websites or
                applications are owned and operated independently of OficeInspector, and may have their own separate privacy
                and data collection practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party;
                therefore, you should review their privacy policies and practices prior to interacting with their
                websites or applications, using any of their tools, or sharing any of your Personal Information with
                them.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Community Forums. Our Sites may offer message boards, chat rooms, blogs, and
                other public areas (“Community Forums”) where you can interact with our employees, other customers, post
                images, data, requests, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content, including your Personal
                Information (“User Submissions”). To participate in Community Forums, you may be asked to select a user
                name and password and/or provide us with your email-address, and to agree to the terms of participation
                for those Community Forums. We use this information to identify you and to contact you, if needed, for
                the provision of those Community Forums. You are able to change your email preferences or discontinue
                your participation in the Community Forums at any time. Your password and your email-address will not be
                visible to other users or shared with third parties. You should be aware that any User Submissions you
                post to a Community Forum, as well as your user name, may be viewed by other members of that forum. If
                you choose to voluntarily post User Submissions to a Community Forum, be aware that such information is
                viewable by anyone else on that Community Forum. Think carefully before you post and use caution before
                disclosing any Personal Information in a Community Forum. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use,
                or misuse of any User Submission that you disclose or receive through a Community Forum. We might also
                delete User Submissions without further notice if they include harmful or inappropriate content (e.g.,
                pornographic material, content encouraging vandalism, crime, terrorism, racism, violence, or cruelty),
                or infringe any third party’s rights or applicable law.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Promotions. We may offer various promotions (“Promotions”) through the Sites or
                elsewhere that may require registration with your Personal Information. If you choose to enter or
                otherwise participate in a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in
                connection with administration of the Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize
                fulfillment, and as otherwise required by law. By entering into a Promotion, you are agreeing to the
                official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including,
                except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice,
                and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. These rules will be displayed to you during the
                registration process, and you will be asked for your consent to the respective data processing at that
                time.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Affiliates and Business Transfers. We may share your Personal Information with
                our affiliates. Additionally, OficeInspector or any part of its business, including our Sites, may be sold at
                some point in the future. Should this occur, your Personal Information may be transferred to a
                subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the business unit or Sites. We also may disclose and transfer
                your Personal Information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale
                of stock or assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any
                due diligence process. In all such cases, this Privacy Policy will continue to govern the use and
                disclosure of such information.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Legal Protections and Law Enforcement. We may access, use, preserve, transfer,
                and disclose to third parties your Personal Information to: (1) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
                subpoena, governmental request, or legal process if, in our good faith opinion, such is required or
                permitted by law; (2) protect and/or defend this Privacy Policy or other policies or terms of use
                applicable to our Sites, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (3) protect the
                safety, rights, property, or security of OficeInspector or any third party; and/or (4) detect, prevent, or
                otherwise address fraud, security issues or breaches, or technical issues. This may include allowing
                third parties, such as copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, and/or
                law enforcement agencies, to access and use your Usage Information in order to identify you. We may take
                any of these steps without notice to you to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">CHOICE AND UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate the identity of any
                individual seeking access to Personal Information. We may provide web pages or other mechanisms on our
                Sites through which you can update subscription preferences. You can also contact us to update your
                Personal Information or change your preferences. Our contact information for these purposes is by email
                at info@OficeInspector.com. If you receive a marketing communication from us by email, you may also opt
                out of receiving future email marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided in
                that email. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to
                transactions you initiate, your customer account, your use of our Sites, or other business matters, and
                that these communications may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from marketing communications.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">In accordance with our routine record keeping and applicable law, we may delete
                certain records that contain your Personal Information. We are under no obligation to store such
                information indefinitely, and we disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction
                of that information. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely
                remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of
                backups and other reasons. Also, if you have posted any User Submissions to a Community Forum, these
                communications cannot generally be removed.</p>

                matter of “contractual
                necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our agreement with you, which
                enables us to provide you with the products and services you request. When we process Personal Data due
                to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use
                some or all portions of the Sites or our products and services that require such Personal Data.</p>
